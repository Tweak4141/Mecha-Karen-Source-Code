# __Mecha Karen Source Code__
In this repository you will find the code in Mecha Karen!<br/><br/>
<br>Disclaimer: This repository only serves as a guide for developers that have some experience with programming. Please do not copy blindy and ask why it does not work. I specifically made this bot to match the needs of how I styled it. If something does not work and you want to know why, I am more than happy to explain but I will not bother to help you if you just copy and paste code.

# Future Notice:
I am slowly stopping open sourcing certain areas of this bot, mainly due to premium coming out soon and many popular features which are being stolen from this bot.<br/>This was one of the reasons why I haven't open sourced the dashboard and Utils folders as then you could ultimately copy the entire bot with ease.

# Other info :
**>** Utils folder will no longer be updated as new files contain sensitive data.

**>** You can use and modify parts of this repository, it serves as a recourse to learn how the discord.py API wrapper works and how you can use it to make your ideas become reality. Please dont steal / claim code's which you haven't created (the copyright world is a deadly place). If you want to know your limits and how to use my works read the limitions stated in the `LICENSE` file.
